# About Me 
<!--Dr. Yifu Wang is currently a Research Engineer of XR Vision Labs at Tencent. -->
* I am currently a Senior Researcher of XR Vision Labs at Tencent. From Apr. 2021 to Jul. 2022, I worked as a Postdoc Research Fellow with Prof. Laurent Kneip in [Mobile Perception Lab (MPL)](http://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/) at Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. At the same time, I also worked as the SLAM Technical Consultant of Motovis Intelligent Technologies, leading a team to work on autonomous driving related projects.
* Previously, I was a Ph.D. student at [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/) from Mar. 2016 to Oct. 2020, advised by Prof. [Laurent Kneip](http://mpl.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/Director.html) and Prof. Hongdong Li. My research interests lie in the area of robotic vision, particularly in visual odometry/SLAM for mulit-camera systems and event-based cameras. Please check my [Research Page](https://1fwang.github.io/publications/) for more details.<br>
