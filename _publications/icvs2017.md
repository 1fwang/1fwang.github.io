<b>Abstract.</b> 
Multi-perspective camera systems pointing into all directions represent an increasingly interesting solution for visual localization and mapping. They combine the benefits of omni-directional measurements with a sufficient baseline for producing measurements in metric scale. However, the observability of metric scale suffers from degenerate cases if the cameras do not share any overlap in their field of view. This problem is of particular importance in many relevant practical applications, and it impacts most heavily on the difficulty of bootstrapping the structure-from-motion process. The present paper introduces a complete real-time pipeline for visual odometry with non-overlapping, multi-perspective camera systems, and in particular presents a solution to the scale initialization problem. We evaluate our method on both simulated and real data, thus proving robust initialization capacity as well as best-in-class performance regarding the overall motion estimation accuracy.
